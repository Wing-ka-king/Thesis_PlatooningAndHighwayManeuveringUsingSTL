**main_SMLv1_0.m** uses the ROS toolbox to interface MATLAB and ROS. The inputs are calculated by the controller implemented by MATLAB, based on feedback received from the subscried topics of the environment and robots, and published on the relevant topics for the robots.

**main6_13_simToVerifyExp.m** re-runs the simualtion after the dimensions and other parameters are scaled to those valid in the experimental setup at Smart Mobility Lab, KTH (https://www.kth.se/dcs/research/control-of-transport/smart-mobility-lab/smart-mobility-lab-1.441539).

The Robots used were Nexus Robotics 4-WD Mecanum drive.

The video of the experiments is available at https://youtu.be/dgwerxm-1Rc.
